abstract = {We observed CO(6 yields 5) and CO(3 yields 2) emission at z = 2.286 from the extremely luminous infrared galaxy IRAS 10214 + 4724. We show that the CO(3 yields 2) line is always comparable in strength to the 1-0 line, in galaxies at high redshift, due to the warmer microwave background. The CO(6 yields 5) line traces warm molecular gas, which is found in the Milky Way only in regions of high-mass star formation. The molecular gas in 10214 + 4724 is warm and dense with n(H2) is about 5000/cu cm if T(kin) = 50 K. The total mass of molecular hydrogen is 1 x 10 exp 11/sq h solar masses. Although this is about 200 times less mass than initially estimated by Brown and VandenBout (1991), it is still 3-5 times larger than the molecular mass of any other galaxy yet observed and 60/sq h more than the H2 mass of the Milky Way. A starburst can power 10214 + 4724 only if predominantly high-mass stars are produced. This extraordinary primeval galaxy has most of its mass in molecular gas, has already collapsed, and is undergoing an extreme starburst that is generating metals in abundances close to solar.},

@article{Carilli2013,
abstract = {Over the last decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line emission has gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects, to a mainstream tool to study galaxy formation, out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has now been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z{\textgreater}1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z{\~{}}7, highly starforming sub-millimeter galaxies (median redshift z{\~{}}2.5), and increasing samples of 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies at z{\~{}}1.5-2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections, to dynamical imaging at kpc-scale resolution, and multi-line, multi-species studies that determine the physical conditions in the interstellar medium. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star formation history of the Universe, as they reveal the phase of the interstellar medium that immediately precedes star formation. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star formation rate density from z{\~{}}0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas to stellar mass ratio in star forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made on determining the CO luminosity to H{\_}2 mass conversion factor at high-z, and the dichotomy between high versus low depletion time values for main sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. Studies of atomic fine structure line emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [CII] 158 micron line to date. This line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization.},

@article{MacKenzie2014,
abstract = {MS{\$}\backslash,{\$}0451.6{\$}-{\$}0305 is a rich galaxy cluster whose strong lensing is particularly prominent at submm wavelengths. We combine new SCUBA-2 data with imaging from Herschel SPIRE and PACS and HST in order to try to understand the nature of the sources being lensed. In the region of the "giant submm arc," we uncover seven multiply imaged galaxies (up from the previously known three), of which six are found to be at a redshift of {\$}z\backslashsim2.9{\$}, and possibly constitute an interacting system. Using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able to simultaneously deblend and fit SEDs to the individual galaxies that contribute to the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far infrared luminosities and star formation rates. The submm arc first identified by SCUBA can now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of these within the galaxy group at {\$}z\backslashsim2.9{\$}. The total unlensed luminosity for this galaxy group is {\$}(3.1\backslashpm0.3) \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}\backslash,\backslashmathrm{\{}L{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, which gives an unlensed star formation rate of {\$}(450\backslashpm50){\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. From the properties of this system, we see no evidence of evolution towards lower temperatures in the dust temperature versus far-infrared luminosity relation for high redshift galaxies.},
